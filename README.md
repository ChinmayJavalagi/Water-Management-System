# AUTOMATION OF WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF A CITY

## Abstract
In a city or town, most houses get their water supply from the City Corporation or Water Board. These authorities usually have a water supply schedule for different areas (aka sectors). The residents of these areas adjust their water usage according to the schedule and have to manually keep track of the next water supply date. Sometimes, due to technical issues with the reservoir or the water board, a sector may not receive water on the expected day. This can cause inconvenience and confusion for the households. Our project automates this process by informing the users about the water supply date for their sector and any possible delays. If there is a delay in a sector, the local officer can notify the database admin and the water supply date will be updated accordingly. Moreover, the user can also check their water bill information and contact details of their sectorâ€™s water supply contractor. Thus, our project will provide a solution for all the water supply problems of a household.
